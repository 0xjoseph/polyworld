Welcome to the polyworld wiki! Contributions from users are welcome.

The most current documentation can be found on the wiki of the official repository, https://github.com/polyworld/polyworld. You can also see a snapshot of the wiki in your local repository, which could be important if you don't have network connectivity or if you're working with an older release and want to view the wiki for that release. Also, any content in the local snapshot will have been reviewed by an admin, hopefully filtering out any bad edits. For more information, please see the page on [using a local wiki snapshot](./Using-a-Local-Wiki-Snapshot).
